# Implementation Plan: Inline vCenter Session Re-login

- **Spec**: [`spec.md`](./spec.md)
- **Research**: [`research.md`](./research.md)
- **Epic**: TBD
- **Date**: 2026-09-03

## Summary

Wrap the vCenter client's SOAP, PBM and REST round trippers so an authentication failure is turned into *re-login + replay the same request* in place, instead of waiting up to a 5-minute keepalive tick. The new chain is selected by a runtime flag (`VC_SESSION_INLINE_RELOGIN_ENABLED`, default off) and lives beside the existing timer-driven handlers until it has soaked.

## Technical context

- **Go version**: as per root `go.mod`.
- **API version(s) touched**: none. No CRD, no status, no webhook.
- **Modules touched**: root module only.
- **Primary dependency**: `github.com/vmware/govmomi v0.56.0-alpha.0.0.20260720221020-d993be43fe66`. No new dependencies. All mechanics re-verified against this version in [`research.md`](./research.md) §2.
- **Blast radius**: one package (`pkg/util/vsphere/client`) plus a flag definition, a flag read at the provider boundary, and a context opt-out threaded into the watcher.

## Constitution check

| Rule | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| API compatibility | N/A | No API group, CRD, or field changes. |
| Thin controllers | OK | Nothing lands in `controllers/`. Logic is in `pkg/util/vsphere/client`. |
| No direct vSphere calls from controllers | OK | Unchanged; this is below the provider abstraction. |
| `+kubebuilder:rbac` | N/A | No new Kubernetes access. |
| Import aliases / grouping (`.golangci.yml`) | OK | New files follow `importas`; `vimtypes`, `pkgcfg`, `pkglog` aliases. |
| Forbidden imports (`depguard`) | OK | No `io/ioutil`, `github.com/pkg/errors`, `k8s.io/utils`. **Note**: `github.com/vmware/govmomi/vapi/internal` is unusable for a different reason — Go's `internal` rule (see [`research.md`](./research.md) §7). |
| Copyright header | OK | On every new file. |
| One suite bootstrap per package | OK | `client_suite_test.go` already exists and is reused. |
| Test labels from `pkg/constants/testlabels` | OK | New specs carry `testlabels.VCSim`, matching the existing `client_test.go`. |
| E2E ships with cluster-observable behavior | OK | See "Test strategy"; a session-termination E2E is part of this change set. |
| New feature flag ⇒ SDD artifacts | OK | This directory. |
| One test file per package | **Deviation** | See "Complexity tracking". |

## Design

### 1. The chain

Today (kept verbatim when the flag is off):

```
vimClient.RoundTripper  = keepalive.NewHandlerSOAP(soapClient, 5m, SoapKeepAliveHandlerFn(...))
restClient.Transport    = keepalive.NewHandlerREST(restClient, 5m, RestKeepAliveHandlerFn(...))
pbmClient.RoundTripper  = <raw derived soap.Client>   // no wrapper at all
```

With the flag on — arrangement **B**, keepalive outermost, per [`research.md`](./research.md) §6:

```
vimClient.RoundTripper  = keepalive.NewHandlerSOAP(reloginSOAP(soapClient, keeper), 5m, nil)
pbmClient.RoundTripper  = reloginSOAP(pbmClient.Client, keeper)
restClient.Transport    = keepalive.NewHandlerREST(restClient, 5m, keeper.restKeepAlive)
                          // where restClient.Transport was first set to
                          //   reloginREST(<original transport>, keeper)
```

Three things this ordering buys, and one it demands:

- The keepalive ping travels **through** the re-login wrapper, so a dead session heals even with zero application traffic, and the ticker never dies permanently.
- The re-login wrapper wraps the **raw** `soap.Client`, never `vimClient.RoundTripper` — wrapping the latter is an infinite loop.
- `session.Manager.Login` re-enters at the **top** of the chain (it holds the `*vim25.Client`), so the login body traverses the keepalive handler and (re)starts the ticker. That is desirable, and it is also the recursion hazard the deny-list below closes.
- **Demanded**: the handler must be installed before the first login, or the ticker never starts.

REST needs its own `send` because `rest.Client.Session()` swallows a 401 and returns `(nil, nil)` — the wrapper never sees a failure to act on. `keeper.restKeepAlive` is today's `RestKeepAliveHandlerFn` routed through the shared mutex.

### 2. The session keeper

One object, shared by all three wrappers, owning everything session-scoped:

```go
type sessionKeeper struct {
    sm       *session.Manager
    rest     *rest.Client
    userInfo *url.Userinfo

    mu  sync.Mutex
    gen atomic.Uint64   // bumped on every successful login
}

// generation() is read BEFORE the first attempt.
// relogin(ctx, gen) takes mu, and if gen != k.gen.Load() another goroutine
// already refreshed -- return nil without logging in. Otherwise log in and
// bump gen.
```

This is the fix for reference-implementation gap §10.1: N goroutines faulting at once produce **one** login and **one** VC session. Read the generation before the call, not after the fault, so a login that lands while the call was in flight is still observed.

SOAP and REST have independent generations (`genSOAP`, `genREST`) — they are separate sessions with separate lifetimes.

### 3. SOAP / PBM wrapper

```go
func (r *reloginSOAP) RoundTrip(ctx context.Context, req, res soap.HasFault) error {
    gen := r.keeper.genSOAP()

    err := r.rt.RoundTrip(ctx, req, res)
    if err == nil || !soap.IsSoapFault(err) {
        return err                       // transport/TLS/HTTP errors pass through
    }
    if !IsNotAuthenticatedError(err) {
        return err                       // NoPermission, InvalidLogin, ... pass through
    }

    action := classify(ctx, req)
    if action == passThrough {           // login/logout/session bodies
        return err
    }
    if lerr := r.keeper.reloginSOAP(ctx, gen); lerr != nil {
        return errors.Join(err, lerr)    // gap §10.2: keep BOTH
    }
    if action == reloginOnly {           // property collector / view bodies
        return err
    }
    if cerr := resetResponse(res); cerr != nil {
        return err
    }
    return r.rt.RoundTrip(ctx, req, res) // exactly one replay
}
```

Notes:

- **Fault matching** reuses the package's existing `IsNotAuthenticatedError` → `fault.Is(err, &vimtypes.NotAuthenticated{})`, which normalizes the value-vs-pointer trap described in [`research.md`](./research.md) §2. Do not hand-roll a type switch.
- **`resetResponse`** zeroes the whole response struct by reflection (`reflect.ValueOf(res).Elem().Set(reflect.Zero(...))`) rather than only the `Fault_` field. Generated methods pass distinct `reqBody`/`resBody` values, so this cannot clobber the request; and it drops any partial `Res` as well as the stale fault. If the response is not a settable struct pointer, bail out and return the original fault rather than retrying blind.
- **One retry, no backoff, no cap** — there is no loop to bound. The fault is raised before the method dispatches, so the server did not act and the replay is safe even for task-creating methods.
- **The VC operation ID is left alone.** The replay reuses the same `ctx`, so `pkgctx.WithVCOpID`'s value rides along unchanged and the fault and its recovery share one op ID in `vpxd` logs. Do not derive a `-retry` suffix — decided in `spec.md`.

`classify` — the deny-list, in one place, with a comment per entry:

| Bodies | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `LoginBody`, `LoginByTokenBody`, `LoginExtensionByCertificateBody`, `LogoutBody`, `CloneSessionBody`, `SessionIsActiveBody` | pass through | Re-entrancy guard. Closes reference gap §10.4 rather than relying on `vpxd` never answering a rejected login with `NotAuthenticated`. |
| `WaitForUpdatesExBody`, `WaitForUpdatesBody`, `CancelWaitForUpdatesBody`, `CreateFilterBody`, `DestroyPropertyCollectorBody`, `DestroyViewBody`, `ModifyListViewBody` | re-login, do **not** replay | `This` names session-scoped state that the re-login just destroyed. The vm-watcher's existing restart loop is the correct recovery ([`research.md`](./research.md) §4). |
| ctx carries `WithNoReplay` | re-login, do **not** replay | Explicit opt-out for callers that own session-scoped state; the watcher marks its goroutine's ctx. |
| everything else | re-login **and** replay | Including PBM, which reads the vim25 cookie live ([`research.md`](./research.md) §3). |

The deny-list and the context opt-out are deliberately redundant: the list cannot be forgotten by a new caller, the context flag is explicit at the site that knows why.

### 4. REST wrapper

```go
func (r *reloginREST) RoundTrip(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    if isSessionPath(req.URL.Path) {
        return r.rt.RoundTrip(req)       // login / logout / session probe
    }
    replay := replayBody(req)            // nil when the body cannot be re-read
    gen := r.keeper.genREST()

    res, err := r.rt.RoundTrip(req)
    if err != nil || res.StatusCode != http.StatusUnauthorized || replay == nil {
        return res, err
    }
    drain(res)                           // read + close so the conn is reusable
    if lerr := r.keeper.reloginREST(req.Context(), gen); lerr != nil {
        return res, nil                  // surface the original 401
    }
    req2 := req.Clone(req.Context())
    req2.Body = replay()
    req2.Header.Set(restSessionHeader, r.keeper.rest.SessionID())
    return r.rt.RoundTrip(req2)
}
```

- `restSessionHeader = "vmware-api-session-id"` and the session path `"/rest/com/vmware/cis/session"` are **redeclared locally** — `github.com/vmware/govmomi/vapi/internal` is not importable from this repo. Comment each constant with its govmomi source.
- The header rewrite is not optional: `rest.Client.Do` stamps the *old* session id before the transport sees the request.
- `replayBody` returns non-nil only when the body is safely repeatable: `req.Body == nil`/`http.NoBody`, or `req.GetBody != nil` (which `http.NewRequest` populates for the `*bytes.Buffer` that `rest.Resource.Request` produces). It returns nil for streaming bodies, so `rest.Client.Upload` of a content-library item is never buffered into memory and never retried.
- `http.RoundTripper`'s contract forbids mutating the request; hence `Clone`.
- Path matching, not method matching, is what keeps login/logout/probe out of the retry — all three share the path.

### 5. Ad-hoc PBM clients

Three call sites build a PBM client directly off the vim25 client and would silently miss the wrapper ([`research.md`](./research.md) §3). Add `func (c *Client) NewPbmClient(ctx) (*pbm.Client, error)` that constructs and wraps consistently, and route those three through it. In legacy mode it returns an unwrapped client, exactly as today.

## Controller / webhook impact

- **Controllers**: none directly. `controllers/virtualmachineimagecache` consumes `c.RestClient()` and benefits transparently.
- **Services**: `services/vm-watcher` keeps its `IsNotAuthenticatedError` / `IsInvalidLogin` restart loop unchanged — with this change it fires on a session that has *already* been re-authenticated, so the restart succeeds on the first try instead of racing the keepalive.
- **Provider**: `pkg/providers/vsphere/client.NewClient` reads the flag from `pkgcfg.FromContext(ctx)` and sets it on `client.Config`. Deliberately **not** read inside `pkg/util/vsphere/client` — that package must stay usable from contexts without a `pkgcfg` (its own `client_test.go` uses a bare `context.Background()`, which `pkgcfg.FromContext` would panic on).
- **Watcher**: `watcher.Start` wraps its goroutine ctx with `client.WithNoReplay`.
- **New RBAC**: none.

## Test strategy

Unit and vcsim, in `pkg/util/vsphere/client/relogin_test.go`, `Label(testlabels.VCSim)`:

- **The vcsim trap** — do **not** drive the retry with a property-collector call (`finder.*`, `property.Collector.Retrieve*`, `object.*.Properties`). Those are on vcsim's no-session allow-list and deliver `NotAuthenticated` via `MissingSet`, above the round tripper; the retry never fires and the test fails for reasons unrelated to the code ([`research.md`](./research.md) §5). Drive it with `methods.GetCurrentTime`, or inject with `simulator.FaultTypeNotAuthenticated`.
- **Spy round tripper** — splice a counting `soap.RoundTripper` in as the wrapper's *underlying* RT and assert on the sequence of `%T` body names. The canonical assertion is `["*methods.CurrentTimeBody", "*methods.LoginBody", "*methods.CurrentTimeBody"]`. Guard the slice with a mutex; the keepalive goroutine calls `RoundTrip` too.
- **Session expiry, not "never logged in"** — log in, read `sm.UserSession(ctx).Key`, terminate it from a second admin client via `session.NewManager(admin).TerminateSession(ctx, []string{key})`. The existing `client_test.go` already uses this two-manager technique.
- **Cases**:
  - SOAP: terminated session → one fault, one login, one replay, caller sees success.
  - SOAP: the stale-fault regression — assert the caller gets success, which only holds if the response was reset.
  - SOAP: `LoginBody` faulting does not recurse (bounded call count).
  - SOAP: `WaitForUpdatesExBody` → login happened, fault still returned, not replayed.
  - SOAP: `WithNoReplay` ctx → same.
  - SOAP: bad credentials → returned error joins the original fault **and** the login failure.
  - SOAP: concurrency — N goroutines faulting together produce exactly one `LoginBody` on the wire.
  - SOAP: non-auth faults (`NoPermission`, `InvalidArgument`) and transport errors pass through untouched, no login.
  - PBM: a PBM call on a dead session recovers.
  - REST: 401 → login → replay with a **rewritten** `vmware-api-session-id`.
  - REST: session-path requests are never retried.
  - REST: a streaming body is not buffered and not retried.
  - REST: keepalive `send` heals a dead session with no application traffic.
  - Keepalive: with a short idle, the ticker survives a session termination (arrangement B), and pings resume.
- **Legacy mode**: the existing `client_test.go` keepalive specs are pinned to flag-off and must keep passing unchanged. Add one spec asserting flag-off produces the current chain shape.

Integration: no new envtest suite. `test/builder/vcsim_test_context.go` gains the mode on `VCClientConfig` so existing `VSphereClientFn` overrides in `controllers/**` and `services/vm-watcher` can exercise either mode; run the vm-watcher suite in both.

E2E: mandatory per `e2e-sync-with-changes.md` — this is cluster-observable. Full design in the next section.

## E2E design

Two `It` blocks in one new spec file, `test/e2e/vmservice/vmservice/virtualmachine/vm_vcsession.go`, exported as `VCSessionRecoverySpec(ctx, inputGetter)` and registered from `test/e2e/vmservice/vmservice_test.go` under a `Context("VM-VCSESSION", ...)`. Both are `Serial` (they take VM Operator's VC session away from every other spec) and both `Skip` unless the flag is on, so a legacy-mode testbed is unaffected.

### Shared setup

- Gate: `skipper.SkipUnlessVCSessionInlineReloginEnabled(ctx, svClusterClient, config)`, a new function following the existing `skipUnlessFSSEnabled` shape — `utils.GetCommandEnvVars(ctx, client, VMOPNamespace, VMOPDeploymentName, VMOPManagerCommand)` then `strconv.ParseBool(envs["VC_SESSION_INLINE_RELOGIN_ENABLED"])`. Add `EnvVCSessionInlineRelogin: "VC_SESSION_INLINE_RELOGIN_ENABLED"` to `test/e2e/vmservice/config/wcp.yaml` and `kind.yaml`.
- Admin VC client: `vcenter.NewVimClientFromKubeconfig(ctx, clusterProxy.GetKubeconfigPath())` (logs in as `testbed.AdminUsername`), with `DeferCleanup(func() { vcenter.LogoutVimClient(c) })`.
- A pre-created, powered-on VM per block, built the way `vm_extraconfig.go` does it, so the recovery assertion measures VM Operator's reaction and not first-boot latency.
- **Restart-count baseline**: record `.status.readyReplicas` and the manager pod's `restartCount` before the disruption, and assert they are unchanged afterwards. This is what proves recovery happened *in process* rather than via a crash-loop, and it holds regardless of timing.

### Block 1 — terminated session (`core-functional`)

Deterministic, non-disruptive, and the direct test of the inline path. No VC downtime, so nothing else on the testbed is harmed.

1. Read the VM Operator solution-user name from the `wcp-vmop-sa-vc-auth` secret in `vmware-system-vmop` (`utils.GetSecret`, `.Data["username"]`).
2. With the admin client, retrieve `mo.SessionManager` (`property.DefaultCollector(admin).RetrieveOne(ctx, *admin.ServiceContent.SessionManager, []string{"sessionList"}, &sm)`) and collect every `sm.SessionList[i].Key` whose `UserName` matches that solution user.
3. `session.NewManager(admin).TerminateSession(ctx, keys)`.
4. Immediately drive a VM operation — `vmoperator.UpdateVirtualMachinePowerState(...)` to `PoweredOff`, then `vmoperator.WaitForVirtualMachinePowerState(...)`.
5. Assert it completes within `vcSessionRecoveryTimeout` (below), and that the manager pod's `restartCount` did not change.

### Block 2 — vpxd restart (`extended-functional`, `disruptive`)

The scenario that motivated this work: the service goes away, connections drop, every session dies server-side.

1. SSH to the VC as root: `e2essh.NewSSHCommandRunner(vcenter.GetVCPNIDFromKubeconfig(ctx, kubeconfigPath), vcenter.VCSSHPort, testbed.RootUsername, []ssh.AuthMethod{ssh.Password(testbed.RootPassword)})`. This is exactly the runner `supervisor.GetControlPlaneVMConnectionDetails` builds at `test/e2e/infrastructure/vsphere/supervisor/apiserver.go:112`.
2. Restart vpxd: `vmon-cli -r vpxd`. **Validate this command on a testbed before merging** — `service-control --restart vmware-vpxd` is the documented fallback if `vmon-cli` is unavailable or restarts too much. Put it in a single `const vpxdRestartCmd` so correcting it is a one-line change.
3. Do **not** trust the command's exit status. Poll for VC to serve again with a *fresh* client — `vcenter.NewVimClient(host, admin, pass)` in an `Eventually` with a generous timeout (vpxd restart can take several minutes on a loaded testbed). Record the wall-clock instant this succeeds; that is `t0`.
4. From `t0`, drive the same VM operation as block 1 and assert it completes within `vcSessionRecoveryTimeout`.
5. Assert the manager pod's `restartCount` did not change.
6. The admin client from the shared setup is dead after the restart — rebuild it after step 3 rather than reusing it, and make the `DeferCleanup` logout tolerant of a client that is already gone.

### What actually distinguishes the two modes

Both blocks would eventually pass with the flag off — the keepalive re-logs in within `keepAliveIdleTime` (5 minutes). **The timing bound is the whole assertion**, so it has to be stated as such rather than left implicit:

```go
// A VM power-state change normally completes in well under a minute. With
// inline re-login the session is restored on the first faulting call, so the
// only added cost is one round trip. With the legacy timer-driven keepalive
// the operation cannot succeed until the next 5m tick. 90s is comfortably
// above the former and comfortably below the latter.
const vcSessionRecoveryTimeout = 90 * time.Second
```

Two honest caveats to carry into review:

- The bound is testbed-speed dependent. It is the reason both blocks are `Serial` — a parallel spec competing for VC would widen the operation's own latency and erode the margin.
- Block 2 measures from "VC answers again", not from "vpxd was restarted", so vpxd's own startup time is excluded from the budget.

Run either block against a legacy-mode build to confirm it actually fails there. A recovery test that passes in both modes is testing nothing.

## Rollout / migration

- **Flag**: `pkgcfg.Config.VCSessionInlineReloginEnabled`, env `VC_SESSION_INLINE_RELOGIN_ENABLED`, **default `false`**.
- **Why `Config` and not `Features.*`** (decided, see `spec.md` "Decisions"): `Features.*` entries mirror Supervisor FSS / capability state (`FSS_WCP_*`, or the capability ConfigMap under `SVAsyncUpgrade`). This is internal transport behavior with no Supervisor capability behind it, so it belongs with `AsyncSignalEnabled` / `AsyncCreateEnabled` on `Config` directly.
- **Ordering**: land the wrapper + tests with the flag off (no behavior change in any environment), then flip the default in a follow-up once it has soaked, then delete the legacy handlers in a third change under its own spec. `SoapKeepAliveHandlerFn` and `RestKeepAliveHandlerFn` stay exported until that third step — `client_test.go` calls both directly.
- **Observability**: log at `Info` on every re-login with the session generation and the triggering method name, so a burst of logins is visible as a burst. This is the signal an operator uses to tell "recovered once" from "flapping".
- **Rollback**: unset the env var and restart the pod. No persisted state, no schema change.
- **Release note**: user-visible only as "VM Operator now recovers from a lost vCenter session on the next call instead of on the next keepalive interval."

## Complexity tracking

| Violation | Why needed | Simpler alternative rejected because |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Constitution says one test file per package (`<package>_test.go`); this adds `relogin_test.go` alongside `client_test.go` | The new specs are ~600 lines with their own spy/simulator scaffolding, and `client_test.go` is already ~470 lines of unrelated keepalive coverage | Appending to `client_test.go` produces a file where the legacy and inline suites are hard to tell apart. The repo's actual practice is one test file per source file (`pkg/util/vsphere/vm/{guest_id,hardware_version,power_state}_test.go`), which this matches. If the reviewer prefers the literal rule, fold `relogin_test.go` into `client_test.go` — no other change is needed. |
| Two mechanisms for "do not replay" (body-type deny-list **and** a context flag) | The deny-list is the safety net a future caller cannot forget; the context flag is the explicit, greppable marker at the one site that knows why | Deny-list only: a new session-scoped call site silently gets replayed. Context only: every existing property-collector path has to be found and annotated correctly, with no backstop when one is missed. |
| Reflection to zero the SOAP response before replay | `soap.HasFault` exposes no way to clear a fault, and a successful second response does not overwrite `Fault_` | Allocating a fresh response and copying it back is the same reflection with more steps. A `ClearFault()` interface would need an upstream govmomi change. |
